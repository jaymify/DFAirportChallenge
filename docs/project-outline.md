# Project Outline
## Software purpose

The client needs this software because it will help them to control the flow of planes at an airport.

The software solves the problem of inefficient flow of air and ground traffic. It also solves the problem of aiding Air Traffic Controllers with their high work flow by potentially automating certain processes.

The software ensures resource efficiency and aims to achieve business objectives within the timescales. Please refer to **User Stories** documentation for further information on the client business objectives.


## The benefits the software will bring to the client include:
- Defines a maximum capacity of planes at the airport at one time.
- The ability to override the capacity if needed.
- The ability to have additional software improvements after initial deployment, such as preventing planes from taking off & landing during stormy weather.
- Air Traffic Control operations may become more efficient and safer by the software automating certain processes such as counting the current number of planes.
    - This may lead to cost savings, too.
    - It may result in better communications.
- The software could be deployed to other airports or runways, creating economies of scale.
- After initial investment, maintenance will be easy to upgrade and deploy.

## The risks associated with the software include:
- Potential bugs in the software, such as:
    - Issues with overriding the capacity limit and the current amount of planes consequently being exceeded.
    - Long-term support maintenance bugs
- Poor risk management itself, such as:
    - Continuously monitoring risks.
    - Missing identifying potential risks.
    - Inaccurately made assumptions of risk likelihood.
- There is no client requirement for assessing what to do in the an external event, such as:
    - A power cut, natural disaster.
    - A change in legislation.
    - Economic factor; building of another terminal for example.
- Human error; how users respond to the software.
    - ATC instructing a plane to land at an airport when software shows it has reached maximum capacity.
    - Conducting focus groups with ATC and other users may help identify these problems early on.
    - Conducting user tests before launching software.
